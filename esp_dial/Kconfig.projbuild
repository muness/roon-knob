            Enable Bluetooth Low Energy HID mode as an alternative/fallback
            to WiFi Roon control. When enabled, the device can act as a
            universal Bluetooth media remote for phones, laptops, and TVs.

            Note: Enabling this increases firmware size by ~100KB and
            requires additional RAM for the Bluetooth stack.
